####Abstract of the Project
The theme I would like to work on is classification and regression with non-textural dataset. The reason I choose this theme is that I would like to become an data scientist in business area. Classification and regression are the most common tools to use to analyse data, so I want to practice the knowledge and techniques I learned in this program in the real world’s cases.

After reviewing all the datasets, I choose the Bank Marketing Dataset in  UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository dataset provide  service to machine learning users and contain over 600 datasets. I choose this datasets because it come from real world and it contains variables which can be applied to machine learning techniques. 
The Portugal banking institution collect the data from their clints with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls). The dataset contains 4521 observers and 17 variables( from May 2008 to November 2010 ), it may contains missing values and replicate data which needed to be cleaned. The variables describe the clients’ socioeconomic status (e.g. martial, job, education, loan, housing), as well as their previous telemarketing campaigns (e.g. contact, campaign, previous, duration) . The independent variable is binary( “yes”, “no” ) data about if the client subscribed a term deposit.
The bank is marketing a long-term deposit account such as bonds and saving account to their existing clients. They intend to improve their telemarketing strategies and to predict the clients who will subscribe more long-term deposit by analysing the dataset they provided.  

My study question is help a bank to predict weather their clients will subscribe the long-term deposit. . By using the dataset which collected by the bank, my project can help the bank to determine such customers and finding an effective telemarketing strategy. This research can improve the efficiency of their marketing department and reduce their expenses. Our research can also help the bank to figure out which existing clients they should advertise a long-term deposit account such as bonds and saving account. 

In order to achieve this goal, I will first have a clear explore of the dataset,  clean the dataset which we can use for analysing it. Then I will choose those important attributes which I can use in the predictive model. Finally, I will develop two prediction models, including decision tree and Naïve Bayes and find the models’ accuracy and precision to judge if I successfully developed the prediction models.



My research questions are:
•	help this bank to predict whether their clients will subscribe the long-term deposit.
•	Compare decision tree and naïve bayes prediction methods
•	Find out if booster dataset will affect results
•	Find out if dataset need to be balanced and if balance the dataset will affect results
